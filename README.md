# Mathieu Functions of first kind

Mathieu functions of first kind are those which are simply periodic, with period either $\pi$ or $2\pi$, that satisfy the equation

$
\begin{equation}\label{Mathieu_eqn}
\dfrac{d^2 f}{dy^2} + \left[a - 2q\cos{(2y)} \right]f = 0
\end{equation}
$

characterized by the coefficient being periodic over the domain. There are two
free parameters, namely q and a, and in the case of simply periodic the *characteristic number* $a = a(q)$, resulting in a necessary condition for the existance of simply periodic solutions. In other words, $f(q, y)$ is a solution of (\ref{Mathieu_eqn}) whenever $a=a(q)$ has finite, unique values.
