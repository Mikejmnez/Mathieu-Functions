# Mathieu Functions of first kind

Mathieu functions of first kind are those which are simply periodic, with period either $\pi$ or $2\pi$, that satisfy the equation

![\begin{equation}
\dfrac{d^2 f}{dy^2} + \left[a - 2q\cos{(2y)} \right]f = 0
\end{equation}

characterized by the coefficient being periodic over the domain. There are two
free parameters, namely q and a, and in the case of simply periodic the *characteristic number* ![a = a(q)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+a+%3D+a%28q%29), resulting in a necessary condition for the existance of simply periodic solutions. In other words, [f(q, y)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+f%28q%2C+y%29) is a solution of whenever ![a = a(q)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+a+%3D+a%28q%29) has finite, unique values.
